# vcsl_for_estuary
a formatted version of the VCSL CC0 Sample library for [Estuary](https://estuary.mcmaster.ca)

To use this library in Estuary, simply type `!reslist "https://carltesta.github.io/vcsl_for_estuary/resources.json"` into the Terminal/Chat.

In the workshops I've been running recently, I've seen folks searching for sounds by typing familiar names of instruments like `s "grandpiano"` or `s "vibraphone"` and I wanted to find a way for folks to be able to easily access those sounds quickly within Estuary. By using the [VCSL CC0 Sample library](https://github.com/sgossner/VCSL) and reformatting the files so that they are in easy to remember folders with natural instrument names I hope to make it easier for folks to use good sounding public domain samples in their Estuary compositions and improvisations.
